### Simulations

#### Description
Power is estimated via simulations.

Two methods are implemented:
Linear model after log(Ax+1) transformation of abundances and a quasi-Poisson model.

Currently only power to detect a general treatment effect is implemented (more to come).

#### Controls
You can specifiy different samples sizes (N, displayed on the x-axis) and the number of simualtions.

Hit the `Run Simulation!` button to start the simulations.
